## Overview

The Imperva Universal Orchestrator extension enables seamless management of cryptographic certificates within the Imperva environment through Keyfactor Command. Imperva uses certificates to secure communication, ensuring that data is encrypted during transmission and only accessible to authorized parties.

In Keyfactor Command, a Certificate Store of the Certificate Store Type represents a repository or location on a remote platform where certificates are stored and managed. For the Imperva extension, this could be locations such as a specific Imperva account with associated API credentials. By defining and leveraging these Certificate Stores, Keyfactor Command can perform various operations such as downloading, adding, and removing certificates in remote platforms, providing centralized control and automation of certificate lifecycle management.
