The Imperva Orchestrator Extension allows for the management of SSL certificates bound to web sites managed by the Imperva cloud-based firewall.

#### Integration status: Production - Ready for use in production environments.

## About the Keyfactor Universal Orchestrator Extension

This repository contains a Universal Orchestrator Extension which is a plugin to the Keyfactor Universal Orchestrator. Within the Keyfactor Platform, Orchestrators are used to manage “certificate stores” &mdash; collections of certificates and roots of trust that are found within and used by various applications.

The Universal Orchestrator is part of the Keyfactor software distribution and is available via the Keyfactor customer portal. For general instructions on installing Extensions, see the “Keyfactor Command Orchestrator Installation and Configuration Guide” section of the Keyfactor documentation. For configuration details of this specific Extension see below in this readme.

The Universal Orchestrator is the successor to the Windows Orchestrator. This Orchestrator Extension plugin only works with the Universal Orchestrator and does not work with the Windows Orchestrator.

## PAM Integration

This orchestrator extension has the ability to connect to a variety of supported PAM providers to allow for the retrieval of various client hosted secrets right from the orchestrator server itself.  This eliminates the need to set up the PAM integration on Keyfactor Command which may be in an environment that the client does not want to have access to their PAM provider.

The secrets that this orchestrator extension supports for use with a PAM Provider are:

|Name|Description|
|----|-----------|
|StorePassword|The Keyfactor certificate store password contains the Imperva API Id and API Key concatenated with a comma (,).  For example: 12345,12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789ABC.  Please refer to your Imperva documentation to learn more about creating API Ids and Keys.

It is not necessary to use a PAM Provider for all of the secrets available above. If a PAM Provider should not be used, simply enter in the actual value to be used, as normal.

If a PAM Provider will be used for one of the fields above, start by referencing the [Keyfactor Integration Catalog](https://keyfactor.github.io/integrations-catalog/content/pam). The GitHub repo for the PAM Provider to be used contains important information such as the format of the `json` needed. What follows is an example but does not reflect the `json` values for all PAM Providers as they have different "instance" and "initialization" parameter names and values.

<details><summary>General PAM Provider Configuration</summary>
<p>



### Example PAM Provider Setup

To use a PAM Provider to resolve a field, in this example the __Server Password__ will be resolved by the `Hashicorp-Vault` provider, first install the PAM Provider extension from the [Keyfactor Integration Catalog](https://keyfactor.github.io/integrations-catalog/content/pam) on the Universal Orchestrator.

Next, complete configuration of the PAM Provider on the UO by editing the `manifest.json` of the __PAM Provider__ (e.g. located at extensions/Hashicorp-Vault/manifest.json). The "initialization" parameters need to be entered here:

~~~ json
  "Keyfactor:PAMProviders:Hashicorp-Vault:InitializationInfo": {
    "Host": "http://127.0.0.1:8200",
    "Path": "v1/secret/data",
    "Token": "xxxxxx"
  }
~~~

After these values are entered, the Orchestrator needs to be restarted to pick up the configuration. Now the PAM Provider can be used on other Orchestrator Extensions.

### Use the PAM Provider
With the PAM Provider configured as an extenion on the UO, a `json` object can be passed instead of an actual value to resolve the field with a PAM Provider. Consult the [Keyfactor Integration Catalog](https://keyfactor.github.io/integrations-catalog/content/pam) for the specific format of the `json` object.

To have the __Server Password__ field resolved by the `Hashicorp-Vault` provider, the corresponding `json` object from the `Hashicorp-Vault` extension needs to be copied and filed in with the correct information:

~~~ json
{"Secret":"my-kv-secret","Key":"myServerPassword"}
~~~

This text would be entered in as the value for the __Server Password__, instead of entering in the actual password. The Orchestrator will attempt to use the PAM Provider to retrieve the __Server Password__. If PAM should not be used, just directly enter in the value for the field.

## Versioning

The version number of a the Imperva Orchestrator Extension can be verified by right clicking on the Imperva.dll file in the Extensions/Imperva installation folder, selecting Properties, and then clicking on the Details tab.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp; 
## Imperva Orchestrator Extension Installation
1. Create the Imperva certificate store type manually in Keyfactor Command by clicking on Settings (the gear icon on the top right) => Certificate Store Types => Add and then entering the settings described in the next section - Certificate Store Type Settings, OR by utilizing the CURL script found under the Certificate Store Type CURL Script folder in this repo. 
2. Stop the Keyfactor Universal Orchestrator Service for the orchestrator you plan to install this extension to run on.
3. In the Keyfactor Orchestrator installation folder (by convention usually C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Orchestrator), find the "Extensions" folder. Underneath that, create a new folder named "Imperva" (you may choose to use a different name if you wish).
4. Download the latest version of the Imperva Orchestrator Extension from [GitHub](https://github.com/Keyfactor/imperva-orchestrator).  Click on the "Latest" release link on the right hand side of the main page and download the first zip file.
5. Copy the contents of the download installation zip file to the folder created in Step 3.
6. (Optional) If you decide to create the certificate store type with a short name different than the suggested value of "Imperva", edit the manifest.json file in the folder you created in step 3, and modify each "ShortName" in each "Certstores.{ShortName}.{Operation}" line with the ShortName you used to create the certificate store type in Keyfactor Command.  If you created it with the suggested value, this step can be skipped.
7. Start the Keyfactor Universal Orchestrator Service.
8. In Keyfactor Command, go to Orchestrators => Management and approve the Keyfactor Orchestrator containing the Imperva capability that you just installed by selecting the orchestrator and clicking APPROVE.

## Creating an Imperva Certificate Store in Keyfactor Command  
To create a Keyfactor Command certificate store of certificate store type Imperva, go to Locations => Certificate Stores and click ADD.  Then enter the following:  
- Category - Imperva (or the alternate ShortName value you entered when creating your certificate store type).
- Container - Optional.  Refer to Keyfactor Command documentation about this feature.
- Client Machine - The URL that will be used as the base URL for Imperva endpoint calls.  Should be https://my.imperva.com
- Store Path - Your Imperva account id.  Please refer to the [Imperva documentation](https://docs.imperva.com/howto/bd68301b) as to how to find your Imperva account id.
- Store Password - Your Imperva API id and API key concatenated with a comma (,}.  For example: 12345,12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789ABC.  Please refer to the [Imperva documentation](https://docs.imperva.com/bundle/cloud-application-security/page/settings/api-keys.htm#:~:text=In%20the%20Cloud%20Security%20Console%20top%20menu%20bar%2C%20click%20Account,to%20create%20a%20new%20key.) as to how to create an API id and key.
