## Overview

The Imperva Orchestrator Extension allows for the management of SSL certificates bound to web sites managed by the Imperva cloud-based firewall.



## Compatibility

This integration is compatible with Keyfactor Universal Orchestrator version 10.1 and later.

## Support
The Imperva Universal Orchestrator extension If you have a support issue, please open a support ticket by either contacting your Keyfactor representative or via the Keyfactor Support Portal at https://support.keyfactor.com.

> To report a problem or suggest a new feature, use the **[Issues](../../issues)** tab. If you want to contribute actual bug fixes or proposed enhancements, use the **[Pull requests](../../pulls)** tab.

## Requirements & Prerequisites

Before installing the Imperva Universal Orchestrator extension, we recommend that you install [kfutil](https://github.com/Keyfactor/kfutil). Kfutil is a command-line tool that simplifies the process of creating store types, installing extensions, and instantiating certificate stores in Keyfactor Command.


The Imperva Orchestrator Extension requires the creation of an Imperva account id, API id, and API key.  Please reference the [Imperva Documentation](https://docs.imperva.com/bundle/cloud-application-security/page/settings/api-keys.htm#:~:text=In%20the%20Cloud%20Security%20Console%20top%20menu%20bar%2C%20click%20Account,to%20create%20a%20new%20key) for more information on creating an API id and key for use with this integration.


## Imperva Certificate Store Type

To use the Imperva Universal Orchestrator extension, you **must** create the Imperva Certificate Store Type. This only needs to happen _once_ per Keyfactor Command instance.








#### Supported Operations

| Operation    | Is Supported                                                                                                           |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Add          | ✅ Checked        |
| Remove       | ✅ Checked     |
| Discovery    | 🔲 Unchecked  |
| Reenrollment | 🔲 Unchecked |
| Create       | 🔲 Unchecked     |

#### Store Type Creation

##### Using kfutil:
`kfutil` is a custom CLI for the Keyfactor Command API and can be used to create certificate store types.
For more information on [kfutil](https://github.com/Keyfactor/kfutil) check out the [docs](https://github.com/Keyfactor/kfutil?tab=readme-ov-file#quickstart)
   <details><summary>Click to expand Imperva kfutil details</summary>

   ##### Using online definition from GitHub:
   This will reach out to GitHub and pull the latest store-type definition
   ```shell
   # Imperva
   kfutil store-types create Imperva
   ```

   ##### Offline creation using integration-manifest file:
   If required, it is possible to create store types from the [integration-manifest.json](./integration-manifest.json) included in this repo.
   You would first download the [integration-manifest.json](./integration-manifest.json) and then run the following command
   in your offline environment.
   ```shell
   kfutil store-types create --from-file integration-manifest.json
   ```
   </details>


#### Manual Creation
Below are instructions on how to create the Imperva store type manually in
the Keyfactor Command Portal
   <details><summary>Click to expand manual Imperva details</summary>

   Create a store type called `Imperva` with the attributes in the tables below:

   ##### Basic Tab
   | Attribute | Value | Description |
   | --------- | ----- | ----- |
   | Name | Imperva | Display name for the store type (may be customized) |
   | Short Name | Imperva | Short display name for the store type |
   | Capability | Imperva | Store type name orchestrator will register with. Check the box to allow entry of value |
   | Supports Add | ✅ Checked | Check the box. Indicates that the Store Type supports Management Add |
   | Supports Remove | ✅ Checked | Check the box. Indicates that the Store Type supports Management Remove |
   | Supports Discovery | 🔲 Unchecked |  Indicates that the Store Type supports Discovery |
   | Supports Reenrollment | 🔲 Unchecked |  Indicates that the Store Type supports Reenrollment |
   | Supports Create | 🔲 Unchecked |  Indicates that the Store Type supports store creation |
   | Needs Server | 🔲 Unchecked | Determines if a target server name is required when creating store |
   | Blueprint Allowed | 🔲 Unchecked | Determines if store type may be included in an Orchestrator blueprint |
   | Uses PowerShell | 🔲 Unchecked | Determines if underlying implementation is PowerShell |
   | Requires Store Password | ✅ Checked | Enables users to optionally specify a store password when defining a Certificate Store. |
   | Supports Entry Password | 🔲 Unchecked | Determines if an individual entry within a store can have a password. |

   The Basic tab should look like this:

   ![Imperva Basic Tab](docsource/images/Imperva-basic-store-type-dialog.png)

   ##### Advanced Tab
   | Attribute | Value | Description |
   | --------- | ----- | ----- |
   | Supports Custom Alias | Required | Determines if an individual entry within a store can have a custom Alias. |
   | Private Key Handling | Required | This determines if Keyfactor can send the private key associated with a certificate to the store. Required because IIS certificates without private keys would be invalid. |
   | PFX Password Style | Default | 'Default' - PFX password is randomly generated, 'Custom' - PFX password may be specified when the enrollment job is created (Requires the Allow Custom Password application setting to be enabled.) |

   The Advanced tab should look like this:

   ![Imperva Advanced Tab](docsource/images/Imperva-advanced-store-type-dialog.png)

   > For Keyfactor **Command versions 24.4 and later**, a Certificate Format dropdown is available with PFX and PEM options. Ensure that **PFX** is selected, as this determines the format of new and renewed certificates sent to the Orchestrator during a Management job. Currently, all Keyfactor-supported Orchestrator extensions support only PFX.

   ##### Custom Fields Tab
   Custom fields operate at the certificate store level and are used to control how the orchestrator connects to the remote target server containing the certificate store to be managed. The following custom fields should be added to the store type:

   | Name | Display Name | Description | Type | Default Value/Options | Required |
   | ---- | ------------ | ---- | --------------------- | -------- | ----------- |

   The Custom Fields tab should look like this:

   ![Imperva Custom Fields Tab](docsource/images/Imperva-custom-fields-store-type-dialog.png)

   </details>

## Installation

1. **Download the latest Imperva Universal Orchestrator extension from GitHub.**

    Navigate to the [Imperva Universal Orchestrator extension GitHub version page](https://github.com/Keyfactor/imperva-orchestrator/releases/latest). Refer to the compatibility matrix below to determine whether the `net6.0` or `net8.0` asset should be downloaded. Then, click the corresponding asset to download the zip archive.

   | Universal Orchestrator Version | Latest .NET version installed on the Universal Orchestrator server | `rollForward` condition in `Orchestrator.runtimeconfig.json` | `imperva-orchestrator` .NET version to download |
   | --------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
   | Older than `11.0.0` | | | `net6.0` |
   | Between `11.0.0` and `11.5.1` (inclusive) | `net6.0` | | `net6.0` |
   | Between `11.0.0` and `11.5.1` (inclusive) | `net8.0` | `Disable` | `net6.0` |
   | Between `11.0.0` and `11.5.1` (inclusive) | `net8.0` | `LatestMajor` | `net8.0` |
   | `11.6` _and_ newer | `net8.0` | | `net8.0` |

    Unzip the archive containing extension assemblies to a known location.

    > **Note** If you don't see an asset with a corresponding .NET version, you should always assume that it was compiled for `net6.0`.

2. **Locate the Universal Orchestrator extensions directory.**

    * **Default on Windows** - `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Orchestrator\extensions`
    * **Default on Linux** - `/opt/keyfactor/orchestrator/extensions`

3. **Create a new directory for the Imperva Universal Orchestrator extension inside the extensions directory.**

    Create a new directory called `imperva-orchestrator`.
    > The directory name does not need to match any names used elsewhere; it just has to be unique within the extensions directory.

4. **Copy the contents of the downloaded and unzipped assemblies from __step 2__ to the `imperva-orchestrator` directory.**

5. **Restart the Universal Orchestrator service.**

    Refer to [Starting/Restarting the Universal Orchestrator service](https://software.keyfactor.com/Core-OnPrem/Current/Content/InstallingAgents/NetCoreOrchestrator/StarttheService.htm).


6. **(optional) PAM Integration**

    The Imperva Universal Orchestrator extension is compatible with all supported Keyfactor PAM extensions to resolve PAM-eligible secrets. PAM extensions running on Universal Orchestrators enable secure retrieval of secrets from a connected PAM provider.

    To configure a PAM provider, [reference the Keyfactor Integration Catalog](https://keyfactor.github.io/integrations-catalog/content/pam) to select an extension and follow the associated instructions to install it on the Universal Orchestrator (remote).


> The above installation steps can be supplemented by the [official Command documentation](https://software.keyfactor.com/Core-OnPrem/Current/Content/InstallingAgents/NetCoreOrchestrator/CustomExtensions.htm?Highlight=extensions).
